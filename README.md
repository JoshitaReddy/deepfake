# DeepFake Detection of Videos & Images
In the era of digital information, the proliferation of deep fake technology poses a significant challenge to multimedia integrity. Detecting these manipulations accurately is paramount to upholding media reliability and trustworthiness. Traditional heuristic-based detection methods are increasingly inadequate against the evolving sophistication of deep fakes.

Our study introduces a pioneering approach for detecting deep fake images, utilizing the YOLOv8 classification architecture. By leveraging this architecture and various optimization techniques during training, we enhance detection accuracy and efficiency. As deep fake technology evolves, proactive measures are vital to safeguarding digital content integrity. Our research contributes to advancing deep fake detection methodologies, essential for mitigating potential harm and preserving the authenticity of digital media in the technical landscape.

In conclusion, as deep fake technology continues to evolve, proactive measures such as innovative detection methods are essential in mitigating its detrimental impacts. By staying at the forefront of research and development, we can effectively combat the threats posed by deep fakes, safeguarding the integrity of digital content and upholding the principles of truth and authenticity in the digital era. It is imperative that we continuously refine our techniques and strategies to stay ahead of malicious actors and maintain the credibility of multimedia content in an ever-changing technological landscape.
